## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a diffusion-based generative model inspired by Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM). The model demonstrates how to train a neural network to gradually denoise an image, starting from pure noise.

## Features

- üß† Neural network-based diffusion model with U-Net architecture
- üîÑ Forward diffusion process (adding noise gradually)
- ‚Ü©Ô∏è Reverse diffusion process (denoising to generate images)
- üìä Training and sampling pipelines
- üöÄ Advanced techniques for better quality:
  - Self-attention mechanisms
  - Cosine noise schedule
  - EMA (Exponential Moving Average) model tracking
  - DDIM sampling for faster and higher quality generation

## Getting Started


## How It Works

### 1. Forward Diffusion

The forward diffusion process gradually adds noise to an image following a predefined schedule:

```python
x_t = sqrt(Œ±_t) * x_0 + sqrt(1 - Œ±_t) * Œµ
```

Where:
- `x_0` is the original image
- `x_t` is the noisy image at timestep t
- `Œ±_t` is the cumulative product of (1-Œ≤_t)
- `Œµ` is random noise sampled from a normal distribution

### 2. Neural Network Training

The U-Net model is trained to predict the noise added during the forward process.

### 3. Reverse Diffusion

During sampling, we start with pure noise and gradually denoise using our model.

## Implementation Details

- **Architecture**: U-Net with self-attention and residual blocks
- **Sampling**: DDIM for faster, higher-quality sampling
- **Optimization**: AdamW with weight decay and learning rate scheduling
- **Stability**: Gradient clipping and EMA parameter updates

## Results

The model demonstrates the ability to reconstruct an image after complete destruction through the diffusion process.
